## How It Works

- **Student Form:**  
  Add a new student or edit an existing one. The form includes fields for name, age, grade, and subject.

  - **Search:** Filter students by name or subject.
  - **Grade Filter:** Show students by selected grade.
  - **Sort:** Sort by any field, toggle order.
  - **Bulk Actions:** Clear all students or export data.

  Appears for destructive actions (delete, clear all) to prevent accidental data loss.

- **Notifications:**  
  Success, error, and info messages appear as toasts in the bottom-right corner.
